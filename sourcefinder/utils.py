def generate_subthresholds(min_value, max_value, num_thresholds):
    r"""
    Generate a series of ``num_thresholds`` logarithmically spaced values
    in the range (min_value, max_value) (both exclusive).
    First, we calculate a logarithmically spaced sequence between exp(0.0)
    and (max_value - min_value + 1). That is, the total range is between 1 and
    one greater than the difference between max_value and min_value.
    We subtract 1 from this to get the range between 0 and
    (max_value - min_value).
    We add min to that to get the range between min and max.

    This formula sets the subthreshold levels:

    .. math::

        t_i = \exp\left(
            \frac{i \cdot \log(\text{max\_value} + 1 - \text{min\_value})}
                 {\text{num\_thresholds} + 1}
        \right) + \text{min\_value} - 1

    for :math:`i = 1, 2, \ldots, \text{num\_thresholds}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_value : float
        The minimum value of the range (not included in the output).
    max_value : float
        The maximum value of the range (not included in the output).
    num_thresholds : int
        The number of threshold values to generate.

        max_value (exclusive).

    In order to derive the error bars for Gaussian fits from the
    Condon (1997, PASP 109, 116C) formulae, one needs a quantity called the
    correlation length. The Condon formulae assume a circular area
    with diameter theta_N (in pixels) for the correlation: i.e. all noise
    within that area is assumed completely correlated while outside that area
    all noise is assumed completely uncorrelated. This was later generalized
    by Hopkins et al. (2003, AJ 125, 465, paragraph 3) for correlation areas
    which are not circular, i.e. for anisotropic restoring beams.

    Basically one has theta_N^2 = theta_B*theta_b.

    Good estimates in general are:

    + theta_B = 2.0 * semimajor

    + theta_b = 2.0 * semiminor

    but we have included this function to provide a convenient way of altering
    these dependencies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    semimajor : float
        The semi-major axis length in pixels.
    semiminor : float
        The semi-minor axis length in pixels.

def fudge_max_pix(semimajor, semiminor, theta):
    """Estimate peak spectral brightness correction at pixel of maximum spectral
    brightness.

    Previously, we adopted Rengelink's correction for the
    underestimate of the peak of the Gaussian by the maximum pixel
    method: fudge_max_pix = 1.06. See the WENSS paper
    (1997A&AS..124..259R) or his thesis.  The peak of the Gaussian
    is, of course, never at the exact center of the pixel, that's why
    the maximum pixel method will underestimate it, when averaged over an
    ensemble. This effect is smaller when the clean beam is more densely 
    sampled.

    But, instead of just taking 1.06 one can make an estimate of the
    overall correction by assuming that the true peak is at a random
    position on the peak pixel and averaging over all possible
    corrections.  This overall correction makes use of the beamshape,
    so strictly speaking only accurate for unresolved sources.
    After some investigation, it turns out that this method requires not only
    unresolved sources, but also a circular beam shape. With the general
    elliptical beam, the peak pixel may be located more than half a
    pixel away from the true peak. In that case the integral below will not
    suffice as a correction. Calculating an overall correction for an ensemble
    of sources will, in the case of an elliptical beam shape, become much
    more involved.

    """
    Solve the transcendental equation for sigma using Newton's method with
    interval safeguards.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : function
        The function to find the root of. It should take three parameters:
        sigma, sigma_meas, and D.
    sigma0 : float
        Initial guess for the value of sigma.
    min_sigma : float
        Minimum bound for sigma.
    max_sigma : float
        Maximum bound for sigma.
    tol : float, default: 1e-8
        The tolerance for convergence.
    max_iter : int, default: 100
        The maximum number of iterations.
    *args : tuple
        Additional arguments for the function `f`.

    Returns
    -------
    sigma : float
        The value of sigma that solves the equation, constrained within the
        bounds [min_sigma, max_sigma].
    i : int
        The number of iterations performed. If convergence was reached, this
        is the iteration count. If max iterations were reached, this is equal
        to max_iter.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the derivative of the function is near zero, causing a division by
        zero error.

    Notes
    -----
    The method employs Newton's method for root-finding, with safeguards to
    ensure that sigma stays within the bounds [min_sigma, max_sigma]. The
    method terminates when the absolute change in sigma is smaller than the
    specified tolerance `tol` or when the maximum number of iterations is
    reached. If the derivative is too small (near zero), a ValueError is raised.

    Complements initial parameters for Gaussian fitting, with fixed values.
    The end result should be a list of six elements, corresponding to 'peak',
    'xbar', 'ybar', 'semimajor', 'semiminor' and 'theta', in that order

    Parameters
    ----------
    initial_params : np.ndarray
        A Numpy float array containing the initial values for at least one, but
        a maximum of six Gaussian parameters: 'peak', 'xbar', 'ybar',
        'semimajor', 'semiminor' and 'theta' , in that order.
    fixed_params : dict
        A dictionary where the keys are zero, one or more of these parameter
        names: 'peak', 'xbar', 'ybar', 'semimajor', 'semiminor' and 'theta'.
        The values are the fixed values for those parameters. It must complement
        initial_parms, such that the total number of parameters is six:
        len(initial_params) + len(fixed_params) == 6.
    fit_params : tuple
        A tuple of the six Gaussian parameters to be fitted. If a parameter is
        found in `fixed_params`, its value is used from there; otherwise, the
        value is taken from `initial_params`.
        Almost always this should be ('peak', 'xbar', 'ybar', 'semimajor',
        'semiminor', 'theta').

    Returns
    -------
    gaussian_args : list
        A list of Gaussian fitting arguments, where each value corresponds to
        either a fixed value or an initial value from `initial_params`.
        len(gaussian_args) == 6.

    Example
    -------
