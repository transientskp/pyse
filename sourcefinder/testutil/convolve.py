def gaussian_from_Sigma_matrix(x, y, I0, mu, Sigma):
    """
    Evaluate a 2D anisotropic Gaussian defined by its covariance matrix.

    The Gaussian is given by

        G(x, y) = I₀ * exp[-½ (r - μ)ᵀ Σ⁻¹ (r - μ)],

    where Σ is the 2×2 covariance matrix describing the ellipse (its
    orientation and semi-axes) and μ = (x₀, y₀) is the centroid position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Coordinate arrays of identical shape giving the pixel positions
        at which to evaluate the Gaussian. Typically created with
        ``np.meshgrid``.
    I0 : float
        Peak intensity (the value of the Gaussian at its center).
    mu : array_like, shape (2,)
        Center coordinates (x₀, y₀) of the Gaussian, in the same units
        as `x` and `y`.
    Sigma : array_like, shape (2, 2)
        Covariance matrix defining the shape and orientation of the
        ellipse. Must be symmetric and positive definite.

    Returns
    -------
    G : ndarray
        The evaluated Gaussian image, with the same shape as `x`.

    Notes
    -----
    - The determinant of Σ controls the spatial extent of the Gaussian.
    - The integral over all space equals

          ∫∫ G(x, y) dx dy = I₀ * 2π * sqrt(det(Σ)).

      This may be useful for flux normalization.
    - If Σ is diagonal, the Gaussian is axis-aligned with standard
      deviations σₓ = sqrt(Σ₀₀) and σᵧ = sqrt(Σ₁₁).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x, y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-5, 5, 101), np.linspace(-5, 5, 101))
    >>> mu = np.array([0.0, 0.0])
    >>> Sigma = np.array([[4.0, 1.0],
    ...                   [1.0, 2.0]])
    >>> G = gaussian_from_Sigma_matrix(x, y, I0=1.0, mu=mu, Sigma=Sigma)
    >>> G.shape

def convolve_gaussians(I1, mu1, Sigma1, I2, mu2, Sigma2):
    """
    Analytically convolve two 2D anisotropic Gaussian profiles.

    The convolution of two Gaussians
    G₁(r) = I₁ exp[-½ (r − μ₁)ᵀ Σ₁⁻¹ (r − μ₁)]
    and
    G₂(r) = I₂ exp[-½ (r − μ₂)ᵀ Σ₂⁻¹ (r − μ₂)]
    yields another Gaussian with parameters:

        Σ_H = Σ₁ + Σ₂
        μ_H = μ₁ + μ₂
        I_H = I₁ I₂ √(|Σ₁| |Σ₂| / |Σ_H|)

    Parameters
    ----------
    I1, I2 : float
        Peak brightnesses of the two input Gaussians.
    mu1, mu2 : array_like, shape (2,)
        Center coordinates (x₀, y₀) of each Gaussian.
    Sigma1, Sigma2 : array_like, shape (2, 2)
        Covariance matrices describing the shape and orientation of
        each Gaussian. Must be symmetric and positive definite.

    Returns
    -------
    I_H : float
        Peak brightness of the convolved Gaussian.
    mu_H : ndarray, shape (2,)
        Center coordinates of the convolved Gaussian.
    Sigma_H : ndarray, shape (2, 2)
        Covariance matrix of the convolved Gaussian.

    Notes
    -----
    - The convolution of two Gaussians is itself a Gaussian, which makes
      this operation fully analytic.
    - The combined covariance matrix is simply the sum
      of the individual covariances.
    - The combined centroid is the vector sum of the input centroids;
      this assumes both functions are defined in the same coordinate
      frame (no shift-invariance correction applied).
    - The normalization factor ensures conservation of integrated flux
      under convolution.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> I1, mu1, Sigma1 = 1.0, np.array([0., 0.]), np.diag([2.0, 1.0])
    >>> I2, mu2, Sigma2 = 1.0, np.array([0.3, -0.2]), np.diag([1.5, 0.5])

    From covariance matrix Sigma (2x2) return (sigma_maj, sigma_min,

    Parameters
    ----------
    Sigma : array_like, shape (2, 2)
        Covariance matrix defining the shape and orientation of the
        ellipse. Must be symmetric.
        Covariance matrix elements: if sigma_maj is major axis stddev,
        sigma_min is minor axis stddev, and theta the position angle (CCW
        from +Y), then

             sxy = -(sigma_maj^2 - sigma_min^2) sin(theta) cos(theta)
    Returns
    -------
    sigma_maj : float
        Standard deviation along major axis.
    sigma_min : float
        Standard deviation along minor axis.
    theta : float
        Position angle of the major axis in radians, in [0, pi).
        Measured from the positive y-axis toward the negative-axis.
    Notes
    -----
    - The covariance matrix Sigma is related to the ellipse parameters
      (sigma_maj, sigma_min, theta) by its eigen-decomposition.
    - The stddevs sigma_maj and sigma_min are the square roots of the
      eigenvalues of Sigma.
    - The position angle theta is derived from the eigenvector
      corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.
